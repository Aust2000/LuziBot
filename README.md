# LuzineriaBot2.0
This is the source code for LuziBot, a general bot with standart commands. The main goal of this project was to make a personal and unique bot to my private server with some friends and to get better at API usage, python, assynchronous programming and general project making (work with issues, github, updates, etc).

The bot was made completely in python using the discord.py API.

The bot is not currently beeing run 24/7.
